### Hi there 👋

## About me
<!--
**reformist/reformist** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Nicholas Djedjos, a software and data analytics engineer interested in the intersection between healthcare, biology, and technology. I'm pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a software application to help doctors spend more time with patients.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, dynamic programming algorithms for gene read mapping, and the mathematics behind PCA, t-SNE, and u-MAP. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with identifying exciting internship and research opportunities.
- 😝 My last internship was at a Columbia MBA-backed start-up, where I integrated the Google Maps API, fixed page errors, and helped deploy the website: https://joinstudentstay.com/
- 💬 My most recent project was WeWater at Columbia Devfest, a web application that allowed people to report water quality tests in NYC and updated on a Mapbox map in real-time: https://devpost.com/software/wewater

- ⚡ Fun fact: I do Taekwondo competitively and can square two-digit numbers quickly!
