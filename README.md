I'm Nicholas Djedjos, a software and data analytics engineer interested in the intersection between healthcare, biology, and technology. I'm pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a software application for healthcare.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, dynamic programming algorithms for gene read mapping, and the mathematics behind PCA, t-SNE, and u-MAP. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with identifying exciting internship and research opportunities.
- 😝 I'm currently interning at Pacific National Northwest Laboratory in Seattle, WA where I am doing DevOps work with AWS and building data pipelines.
- 💬 My most recent project was Beetcode, a LeetCode helper, which I developed with Brandon Pae. It has over 200 users and is live on the Chrome Extension store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/beetcode/efiojecmnbhdecicbfnejfnegennfhlf?hl=en
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do Taekwondo competitively and can square two-digit numbers quickly!
