I'm Nicholas Djedjos, a software and data analytics engineer interested in the intersection between healthcare, biology, and technology. I'm pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a software application to help doctors spend more time with patients.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, dynamic programming algorithms for gene read mapping, and the mathematics behind PCA, t-SNE, and u-MAP. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with identifying exciting internship and research opportunities.
- ðŸ’¬ My most recent project was WeWater at Columbia Devfest, a web application that allowed people to report water quality tests in NYC and updated on an OpenBox map in real-time: https://devpost.com/software/wewater
